The source code in this project is a combined fork of the work done in:
 - [slack-integrations-api](https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup/slack-integrations-api)
 - [slack-integrations-core](https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup/slack-integrations-core)
 - [springboot-slack-integrations](https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup/springboot-slack-integrations)

A big thanks to the [Andy](https://github.com/aglassman) and the [Greater Milwaukee Java Meetup](https://github.com/GreaterMKEMeetup).

Also, much love to Slack, Niantic, Pokemon, Nintendo and anyone else I may be forgetting. This was purely a fun and experimental project.
